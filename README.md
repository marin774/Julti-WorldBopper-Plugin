# Julti WorldBopper Plugin
A Julti plugin which keeps your saves folder under a certain size. This helps keep the disk space low and it helps MultiMC to load the instance settings faster (since it has way less worlds to load).

## Installation
Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/marin774/Julti-Worldbopper-Plugin/releases), then drag and drop into your Julti plugins folder, and restart Julti.

## Setup
Once you installed the plugin and restarted Julti, run the quick setup:
1. Open the "Plugins" tab in Julti.
2. Click on "Open Config" next to WorldBopper.
3. Enable WorldBopper by clicking on the "Enable WorldBopper?" checkbox.

## Config
- **Enable WorldBopper?** - Whether worlds should be actively bopped or not.
- **Keep worlds with nether enters?** - Whether to delete 'Random Speedrun #' worlds which have reached Nether. You can still manually clear them in Julti by running `clearworlds` or by pressing File Utilities > Clear Worlds.
- **Max worlds folder size** - Maximum number of worlds (that aren't nether enters, if that option is enabled) to keep in the `saves` folder. This number has to be between 5 and 5000.
